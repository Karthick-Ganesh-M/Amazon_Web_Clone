                                                                üõçÔ∏è Amazon Web Clone
                                                                
This project is a responsive web-based clone of the Amazon homepage, designed to replicate the core UI/UX components of a leading e-commerce platform. Built using HTML5, the structure of each webpage‚Äîsuch as the navigation bar, product sections, and layout grids‚Äîhas been carefully crafted to mirror Amazon‚Äôs interface. CSS3 is used extensively to style the layout, ensure visual appeal, and enable responsive behavior across various devices. Interactive elements such as banner sliders, dropdowns, and product carousels are powered by JavaScript, bringing the site to life with dynamic rendering and user interactivity. Font-based icons are utilized to represent components like the shopping cart, user login, and search, contributing to a familiar and intuitive user interface. Additionally, Google Fonts are employed to enhance the overall typography and maintain a clean, modern design. While this clone does not connect to a backend or real product database, it serves as a strong foundation for understanding the frontend architecture of large-scale e-commerce platforms and practicing UI development skills.
